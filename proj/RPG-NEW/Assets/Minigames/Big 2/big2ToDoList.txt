This system will handle the big 2 minigame.

Each card will be given a value. 
2 will have the highest value.
3 will have the lowest value.
When someone starts the "round" by placing the first card
	- detect the "card type" eg. single,pair,triple ect.
	- detect the card value
	- and place the "round starter"

When someone places a card down.
	- It detects the new highest value.
	- It places the "round starter on the player that places the card down.

When the player with the "round starter" has his turn come back that is onsidered as the round end and
the process is repeated.

After everyturn the player is checked if they have an empty hand.
	- If they have an empty hand they win
	- Otherwise they are ignored
