What is this system?

This system will take care of all player stats both passive(to do with interactions with the world) and active(to do 
with combat and movement speed ect.).

To Decide - How to handle leveling inside player stat system or create seperate system.

Todo in this system
	--Things that need to be decided or done (* means "urgent")--
	- Decide how to save the playerStats when game closed*	
	- If choose to include leveling into this system then create the necesary functions and UI featues
	- Decide how to link abilities with profession choice*
	- Implement professions( The profession you "equip" decides what active base stats you have)
		- EG.
		- Equip thief profession
		- strength = 2
		- speed = 0.8f
		- Change and equip warrior pofession
		- strength = 6
		- speed = 0.3f
		ect.

	--All the following can be done once the system is deemed as almost finished--
	- Create a initial player profesion and job scene
	- Add other classes(both active and passive options)

	--Once all is finished procede to polish all the code and make the game run as smooth as possible--
